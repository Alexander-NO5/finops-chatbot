    "ri utilization": "The percentage of Reserved Instances being used in a given time period. It measures how effectively reserved capacity is utilized to optimize cost savings.",
    "ri": "__alias__: reserved instances",
    "reserved instances": "A pricing model offered by cloud providers like AWS that allows you to reserve compute capacity for a fixed term, typically 1 or 3 years, in exchange for a lower hourly rate compared to on-demand pricing. This provides capacity reservation and cost savings.",
    "saving plan": "A flexible pricing model from AWS that offers significant discounts on compute usage (up to 72%) in exchange for committing to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) over a term. Savings Plans apply across instance families, sizes, regions, OS, and tenancy.",
    "ec2": "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, enabling users to run virtual servers and scale computing resources on demand.",
    "cloudtrail": "An AWS service that records and logs all API calls made within your AWS account, providing audit and governance capabilities to track user activity and detect unauthorized actions.",
    "showback": "A FinOps cost reporting method where cloud usage and cost data are reported back to teams or departments to increase awareness, but without charging or billing them directly.",
    "chargeback": "A FinOps approach where cloud costs are allocated and billed back to the consuming teams or departments based on their actual usage, encouraging accountability for spend.",
    "finops": "Financial Operations (FinOps) is a discipline and cultural practice that combines financial accountability with cloud operations to manage and optimize cloud spend effectively across organizations.",
    "cloud cost optimization": "The process of monitoring, analyzing, and reducing cloud expenditures by applying best practices such as rightsizing resources, using reserved instances or savings plans, and eliminating waste.",
    "cloud governance": "The framework of policies, processes, and controls implemented to manage cloud usage, security, compliance, and costs across an organization.",
    "spot instances": "A purchasing option in AWS EC2 that allows users to bid on spare compute capacity at significant discounts, with the risk of interruptions when capacity is needed by others.",
    "on-demand instances": "EC2 instances that you pay for by the hour or second with no long-term commitments, ideal for unpredictable workloads.",
    "aws lambda": "A serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources, allowing you to pay only for the compute time you consume.",
    "fargate": "A serverless compute engine for containers that works with Amazon ECS and EKS, removing the need to provision or manage servers.",
    "cost allocation tags": "User-defined tags applied to cloud resources to organize and track costs by project, team, environment, or other categories.",
    "multi-cloud": "The use of multiple cloud service providers simultaneously to improve resilience, optimize costs, or leverage best-of-breed services.",
    "hybrid cloud": "A cloud computing environment that combines on-premises infrastructure with public and/or private cloud resources, enabling data and application portability.",
    "reserved instance marketplace": "An AWS service that allows users to buy and sell reserved instances, providing flexibility to adjust reserved capacity holdings.",
    "budget alerts": "Notifications configured in cloud billing systems that alert teams when spending exceeds predefined thresholds.",
    "tagging": "Applying metadata to cloud resources to help organize, manage, and track assets and costs effectively.",
    "rightsizing": "The practice of matching cloud resources to actual workload needs, avoiding overprovisioning and reducing costs.",
    "orphaned resources": "Unused or unattached cloud resources that continue to incur costs and should be identified and cleaned up.",
    "cost anomaly detection": "Tools and processes that identify unusual or unexpected cloud spend patterns to quickly detect cost overruns or misuse.",
    "cloud spend forecast": "An estimate of future cloud costs based on historical usage patterns and planned changes.",
    "cloud financial accountability": "Ensuring that teams or business units are responsible and aware of their cloud spending through reporting, budgeting, and chargeback.",
